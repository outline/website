### Sign In with Slack

Sign In with Slack means your team doesn't have to worry about invites, passwords, or managing new team members. Everyone on your team can login with their existing Slack account and will automatically join your private knowledge base.

> Note: Your team will also get a matching custom subdomain that you can link to from elsewhere.


### Search your Knowledge base

Optionally [Connect to Slack](https://app.getoutline.com/settings/integrations/slack) to enable the `/outline` slack command. Once enabled, team members can easily search your wiki from within Slack by typing `/outline search term`, and post results directly back to the Slack channel.

### Notifications

Outline can optionally post into any Slack #channel when documents are created or edited. You can also choose to route notifications based on the Collection.
