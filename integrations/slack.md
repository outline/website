### Sign In with Slack

Sign In with Slack means your team doesn't have to worry about invites, passwords, or managing new team members. Everyone on your team can login with their existing Slack account and will automatically join your private knowledge base.

> Note: Your team will also get a matching custom subdomain that you can link to from elsewhere.


### Search from Slack

Optionally [Connect to Slack](https://app.getoutline.com/settings/integrations/slack) to enable the `/outline` slack command. Once enabled, team members can easily search documents from within Slack by typing `/outline search term`, and post results directly back to the Slack channel for everyone to see.
