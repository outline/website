### Sign In with Microsoft

Sign In with Microsoft means your team doesn't have to worry about invites, passwords, or managing new team members. Everyone on your team can login with their existing Microsoft organization and will automatically join your private knowledge base.

Simply [create a new team](https://app.getoutline.com/create) with Microsoft as the authentication provider, and your team members will be able to sign in with their Microsoft account.

> Note: Your team will also get a matching custom subdomain that you can link to from elsewhere.
