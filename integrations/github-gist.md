In an Outline document, paste a link to a public [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and it will be immediately converted into an embedded version. Embedding code in your knowledge base is a great way to document best practices.

Outline also supports native code blocks, simply start a line with three backticks (```) to create a code block with syntax highlighting.
