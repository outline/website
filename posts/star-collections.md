![Outline sidebar with starred collections](/images/star-collections.png)

Just like documents, collections can now be starred â€“ once starred you can also
re-order all of your stars with drag and drop to create your own custom sidebar.
Star the things that are important to _you_ and have them available for one-click
access.

**Tip:** Did you know that adding an emoji in front of a document title will show it
in the browser favicon and in the sidebar when starred?
