### New Features

- We added the ability to export all your data out of Outline. There's a new tab under settings "Export Data" and a new option to export all documents for a collection in the overflow menu. [#684](https://github.com/outline/outline/pull/684)

### Enhancements

- Now displaying the "joined at" date on the people listing in admin.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that would display admin options to non-admin users (though they would error with attempted use)
- Squashed an error when uploading images that might result in a "Document failed to save" message. [#685](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/685)
