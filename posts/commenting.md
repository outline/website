![Outline comments](/images/comments.png)

It's been a long time coming â€“ commenting is finally available in Outline, opening up a whole new world of use cases and collaboration!
While we iron out the kinks it's disabled by default, but you can enable the feature for your team in **Settings -> Features -> Commenting**.

Once enabled you'll see a new comments sidebar become available. You can add comments to any document or to a specific
text selection, we also support threaded replies, notifications, **@mentions**, basic formatting _and_ images in comments.

We're eager to hear your feedback, please [let us know](https://www.getoutline.com/contact) what you think.
