### New Features

Groups! It's now possible to organize your team into groups and assign groups with read or write permissions to collections. You can use this to give part of your team read-only access and retain write access for others.

You can manage groups from **Settings -> Groups** or directly from any **Collection -> Permissionsâ€¦**
