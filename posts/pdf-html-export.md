![PDF export in Outline](/images/pdf-download.png)

We are pleased to announce a new feature that allows you to export your documents in PDF and HTML format. This is a useful and much requested addition for anyone who needs to share their work with others but not publish documents on the public internet. PDFs are widely accepted and easily readable on any device.

You can access the functionality from any document menu, then select _Download_ -> _PDF_, the file generation process will take a few seconds depending on the size of the doc and the number of embedded images.
