This update fixes an important issue where Slack integrations would be associated with the first user in the database. On the hosted version of Outline all of these integrations ended up associated with an inactive test user and have since been purged from the db.

**If you connected Slack since June 3rd 2018 you'll need to do so again.**

### Fixes

- Associate Slack integrations with the correct user (see note above ^)
- Very long document titles now overflow and ellipse correctly everywhere in the UI. [#724](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/724)
- A number of small markdown parsing issues in exceptional situations that could cause a document to fail to render. [#723](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/723)
