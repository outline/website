![Group mentions](/images/group-mentions.png)

You can now mention groups in documents and comments, making it easier to notify entire teams or departments at once. To mention a group, simply type "@" followed by the group name, just like you would with individual users.

When a group is mentioned, all members of that group will receive a notification, so use sparingly! Of course, this feature can also be disabled on a per-group basis.

### Other improvements

- Groups can now have a description
- You can now comment directly on images within documents.
- Documents and collections in the sidebar now have context menus
- Typed urls are now automatically converted into clickable links
