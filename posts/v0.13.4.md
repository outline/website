### Fixes

- Slack integrations can now be set up by users that are authenticated through Google OAuth. Previously If you signed in with Google and then tried to setup an integration it would fail. [#730](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/730)
- Fixed an issue where once a share link had been revoked the same document could not be shared by the same user again. [#733](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/733)
- Fixed the link to developer documentation from the [token settings](https://www.getoutline.com/settings/tokens).
- Fixed a potential JS error when clicking badly formatted links in a document.
