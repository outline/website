![Collection sharing](/images/collection-sharing.png)

This week brings some great improvements to public sharing. You can now share an entire collection to the public internet – this much-requested feature is great for sharing structured help docs or several related documents with a single link, and works exactly the same as sharing a single document.

As an additional security measure the Share button will also display a globe icon if a collection is shared publicly.
