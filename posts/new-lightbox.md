![Link mention formatting](/images/new-lightbox.png)

We've completely rebuilt the lightbox that appears when you click into an image. It now supports navigating between all the images and diagrams in a document, as well as zooming in and out, panning large images, and full keyboard and touch navigation.

### Other improvements

- Typed URLs will now automatically convert to links when you press space or enter
- It is now possible to format text across cells in a table
- You can now right click on documents and collections to access the context menu
