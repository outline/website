The comment sidebar can now be sorted by the comment's position in the document. This is particularly nice for
long documents where you want to see the comments in the order they appear rather than the order they were created.

Look for the sort option in the top right of the comment sidebar.

### Other improvements

- When mentioning a user you can now search by email
- Publicly shared docs now have the option to disable search engine indexing
- CSV files can now be imported, they will be converted to a table
- Collections now include reverse alphabetical sorting as an option
