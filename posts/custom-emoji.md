Passkey support has been added as an optional login method. You can now sign in with biometric authentication (TouchId, Windows Hello) or security keys instead of a password. Existing workspaces will need to enable this on the authentication providers screen.

Also in this release – custom emoji. Upload your own custom icons and emoji in the admin settings and use them in your documents, comments, and reactions. Custom emoji can also be embedded in documents as small icons.
