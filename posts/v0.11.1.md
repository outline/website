### Fixes

- `CMD+S`, `CMD+Enter`, `Esc` keyboard shortcuts now work whether the editor is focused or not instead of triggering the default browser actions
- Improved the styling of inline code blocks
- The copy to clipboard button on code blocks now reads "Copy" instead of "Copied!" by default.
- `CMD+Enter` shortcut now saves and leaves edit mode, as it should
- Fixed an issue where navigating documents could occasionally mark them as modified
