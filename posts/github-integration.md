The new GitHub integration allows you to connect your GitHub repositories to your Outline workspace.
Once connected, links to GitHub issues and pull requests will show detailed information on hover,
in a future update we will also allow expanding these links to show more context inline.

To setup simply head to **Settings -> Integrations -> GitHub** and connect one or more organizations.
