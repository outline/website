### Enhancements

- We added the ability to "Pin" a document to a collection. You can use this to welcome team members, make sure they see the most important documents first, or something else wonderful we haven't yet thought of.
- Documents and collections now sort in a more natural order

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that would cause published drafts not to appear correctly in the collection tree
