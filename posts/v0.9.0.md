### Enhancements

- Added the option to duplicate any document from the overflow (...) menu. [#672](https://github.com/outline/outline/pull/672)
- Outline now tracks signin and active times and ip addresses for security and analytics purposes.
- Added toast messages when copying a link so you know that you know it's on your clipboard!

### Fixes
