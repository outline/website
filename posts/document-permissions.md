![Document permissions](/images/document-permissions.png)

This week brings user management to the document level. Previously all permissions were managed on
Collections, but now you are able to share individual documents with specific people to view or edit.
This is great for sharing private notes or drafts with a small group of people.

We also gave the sharing interface a new look and a lot more clarity over who has access to the
document and what level of access they have.

To get started, simply click the **Share** button in the document header or check out the [sharing documentation](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/guide/doc/sharing-LG2sGOLIpl) for more details.
