[Toggle blocks](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/guide/doc/toggles-LNZgXe0o2b) are a new block type that allows you to hide and show content with a click. This is useful for creating collapsible sections in your documents, such as FAQs, step-by-step instructions, or any content that you want to keep hidden until the reader chooses to reveal it.

To create a toggle block, simply type `/toggle` and select the "Toggle" block from the menu. You can then add a title for the toggle and any content you want to include inside it. When the document is published, readers will see the toggle title and can click on it to expand or collapse the content.

### Other improvements

- Search results are now highlighted in the document when navigating from search
- We added a new Figma integration which allows unfurling information about Figma links in documents
