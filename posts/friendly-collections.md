![Friendly collection url](/images/friendly-url.png)

This week we've shipped lots of little improvements, one thing you might notice is that collections in Outline no longer have a long `UUID` in the address bar, instead you'll see a shortened id and a friendly
version of the collection name. Not only is this nicer to look at, but it also makes quickly returning to
collections via searching in the address bar much easier!

### Other fixes and improvements

- Application size was decreased by several hundred KB
- Shortcut for toggling the Table of Contents was changed to `ctrl`+`alt`+`h`
- New language option â€“ PortugÃªse (Brazil) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
- Copying a share link to clipboard no longer includes dark mode styles when pasting into another rich editor
- Fixed alignment of items in "New from template" menu
- Fixed an issue where two `Restore` options would appear on a deleted document that was previously archived
- Fixed background color of select inputs in dark mode on non-Mac platforms
- Improved the performance of loading share links for documents with many attachments
