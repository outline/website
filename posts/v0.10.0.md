### Enhancements

- Self-hosted installations can now specify a set of allowed google domains for signin. Account creation outside of this set of domains is disallowed. To setup see the `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` env variable [documentation](https://github.com/outline/outline/blob/master/.env.sample#L23-L25) â€“ thanks to new contributor [Satyadeep](https://github.com/satyadeepk) ðŸŽ‰ [#681](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/681)
- Share links are now soft deleted, to maintain a record of who created and revoked them.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused newlines to appear on save with deeply nested lists. [#676](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/676)
- Restored table of contents functionality. You'll now see a minimal TOC on the right hand side of documents that contain more than one heading to allow quick navigation.
- Fixed an issue that would cause focus in the link toolbar to be lost when autosave triggers [#674](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/674)
- We improved the handling of document error states when attempting to load documents while offline.
