We're continuing to make great headway with two big features in February; rewriting the editor to be more stable and performant (think 10x faster!) and bringing group permissions to the app. In the meantime, some important fixes have also been made in the last few weeksâ€¦

### Fixes

- It's now possible to access documents with _ or ~ characters in the title, previously links would break
- Also, it was possible for navigation to get 'stuck' when moving between documents with similar titles, this no longer happens
- Slack notifications are now working correctly again
- The app will no longer break if a deploy happens between loading the app and loading a document (quite the edge case!)
