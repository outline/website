![GitHub and Linear integrations](/images/github-linear.png)

We have rolled out an improved [GitHub](https://github.com) integration that allows embedding rich issue and pull request information directly
into an Outline document. Not only that, but we've also added the same support for [Linear](https://linear.app?ref=outline), allowing seamless integration of Linear issues, GitHub PR's, and Outline documents.

These new mentions will, of course, stay automatically up-to-date. To get started connect your GitHub and Linear accounts in **Settings -> Integrations**
and then paste an issue or pull request URL from GitHub or Linear into the editor.
