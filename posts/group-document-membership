![Group permissions](/images/group-document-permissions.png)

It is now possible to add groups directly to documents, all members of the group will receive access to the document and all nested documents
with the chosen permissions. Use this to share portions of a larger collection with a mix of stakeholders.

Groups will appear as a new sharing option in the existing Share button. See the [guide to sharing](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/guide/doc/sharing-LG2sGOLIpl) for more info.

### Other improvements

- You can now embed any webpage with the `/embed` command
- Added `R` language highlighting in code blocks
- Templates can now be shared with the entire workspace
- The `e` shortcut now refocuses the editor if unfocused
