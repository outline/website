We've been working on a [Zapier](https://zapier.com) integration. If you're interested in hooking Outline events up to other aspects of your teams workflow, give it a look! React to documents being created or automatically create documents in specific collections from external events. [Find more information on the Zapier integation here](https://github.com/outline/outline-zapier).

### New Features

- The dashboard now features three tabs "Recently viewed", "Recently updated", and "Created by me" to allow easier discovery. We also added infinite pagination to these dashboard tabs
- This release adds the ability to restrict public sharing of documents, check out the new [security section](https://www.getoutline.com/settings/security) in your Outline settings

### Enhancements

- Improved performance of the editor when typing in large documents
- Creating a new document now shows a menu to clarify and choose exactly where the document will go

### Fixes

- The block toolbar items were incorrectly colored, making them difficult to see
