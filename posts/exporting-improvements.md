We've made some great improvements to the way that document exports are constructed this week.
These changes allow Mermaid diagrams and rich embeds to be rendered correctly in HTML and PDF exports
going forward, other formatting was also improved to make these look even nicer.

### Other fixes and improvements

- Embedded videos now display correctly when viewing a documents history
- Emoji's in templates are now applied correctly
- Mobile now has a "Share" option in the document menu
- Todo items in editor can now be toggled with `Cmd`+`Enter` (`Ctrl`+`Enter` on Windows)
- When copying a document you can now choose whether to include child documents
- Added support for Instagram and LinkedIn embeds
