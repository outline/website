This week we've made some highly requested improvements to tables in Outline, this will be one of
many improvements to the editor in the coming weeks and months. Here's what's new:

- **Column resizing**: You can now resize columns by dragging the border between them
- **Full-width tables**: Tables now expand to the full width of the editor
- **More content**: Table cells now support embeds, code blocks, and all other content types
- **Toggleable headers**: You can now toggle a header row and column
- **Improved overflow**: Tables now scroll horizontally when they're too wide for the editor
- **Improved row and column controls**: We've made it one click to add rows and columns
