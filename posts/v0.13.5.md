### Fixes

- It's now possible to create links to anchors within a document, clicking those links will scroll correctly and not hide the heading behind the top bar.
- Clicking anchors next to headings now copies a link to the clipboard [#739](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/739)
- There is now a 100 character limit on document titles
- If a document errors while rendering it no longer renders the entire app unusable. We also added more error details to make bug reporting easier. [#737](https://github.com/outline/outline/pull/737)
