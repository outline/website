Tables now have the ability to merge and split cells across rows and columns, use this to create more complex data layouts. You can merge cells by selecting multiple cells and using the merge option in the toolbar. To split a merged cell, select it and choose the split option.

We also added a new shortcut to create a table, just type `|--` on a new line to insert a table.

### Other improvements

- Hungarian language support
- English (UK) language support
- There is now an option to disable commenting per-collection
- Added a new option on shares to show the last modified timestamp on publicly shared docs
