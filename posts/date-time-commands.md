![Outline date time commands](/images/date-time-commands.gif)

We added some new slash commands to insert the current date, time, or both into a document
you're editing – and importantly these commands also work in document titles and
are locale-aware! These are the new handy shortcuts:

- `/date` – Insert current date
- `/time` – Insert current time
- `/datetime` – Insert current date and time
