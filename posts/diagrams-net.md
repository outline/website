[Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) (Diagrams.net) diagrams are now fully supported, insert new diagrams through the block menu or by uploading an existing SVG or PNG that was created in [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/).

The original diagram data will be preserved and can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button that appears in the image toolbar. This will open the diagram in Diagrams.net where you can make changes and save, the updated diagram will then be reflected in your document.
