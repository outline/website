![Outline find and replace](/images/document-mentions.png)

This week brings the ability to mention documents using the `@` trigger. You'll find documents
available alongside team members. This allows you to link to other documents within your content
and keep the title and icon automatically updated. Keep typing to filter or create a new document inline.

- Group management has been improved and now includes filtering and sorting
- @mentions are now included in find and replace
- Added the `Protobuf` language for code blocks
- `HEIC` images are now supported for embeds
- Added an additional "Neon" highlighter color
- Triple clicking inline code now selects it
- Find and replace now includes a count of occurrences
