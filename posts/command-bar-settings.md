It's now possible to access all the settings screen directly from the command bar.
You can access the command bar anywhere in the app using `Cmd` + `k`, or
`Cmd` + `Shift` + `k` if you're in the document editor.

If you've not used the command bar yet, it's a fast way to access lots of
functionality without taking your hands off the keyboard!
