![Guest role](/images/guest-role.png)

We've added a new **Guest** role to help you collaborate with external users on your documents.
The Guest role allows you to share your documents with external users without giving them full
access to your workspace.

When you invite a user as a Guest, they can only view and comment on the documents and collections
you explicitly share with them â€“ no default access applies.
