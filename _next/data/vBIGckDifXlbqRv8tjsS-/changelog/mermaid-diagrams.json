Mermaid is a simple markdown-like syntax for generating diagrams and flowcharts from text. It's a great way to add diagrams of all types directly in your documentation.\n\nYou can insert a Mermaid diagram directly into a document by using the /mermaid slash command or by setting the code block language to \"Mermaid Diagram\".\n\nHere's an example of a flowchart:\n\n![Mermaid diagram](/images/mermaid-diagram-source.png)\n\nWhich renders as:\n\n![Mermaid diagram](/images/mermaid-diagram.png)\n\nFor full documentation on all the syntax and types of graphs that can be created be sure to check out the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/mermaid-diagram-source.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
