It's now possible to restrict all sign-ups\nto your team to a specific domain name through \"Allowed domains\". This setting applies in _addition_ to\nSSO and will disallow users from creating accounts that do not have a confirmed\nmatching email domain.\n\nWe also added the ability to restrict sign-ups through SSO completely, so that\nusers must first be invited by an admin. Both of these new settings can be found\nunder **Settings** -> **Security**.","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/team-domains.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
