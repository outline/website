{"pageProps":{"title":"👋 Hallo, 你好, こんにちは","slug":"community-translation","date":"2020-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n![Outline translations](/images/translations.png)\n\nThis week we're really excited to kick-off a community translation project. Over the last month there has been a lot of work to hook up the framework and processes for accepting translations and it's now finally ready to use. A special thanks\ngoes out to [André Glatzl](https://github.com/glaand) for pushing this forward.\n\nIf you'd like to see Outline translated into your native language and can offer a little time to help out, it's easy to contribute – simply head to [translate.getoutline.com](https://translate.getoutline.com) and sign up for a free CrowdIn account. Accepted translations are automatically merged back into the codebase and will be available in the following release.\n\nRight now German and Portugese are already >30% complete and we're looking for some folks to take the lead on Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish in particular.","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/translations.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
