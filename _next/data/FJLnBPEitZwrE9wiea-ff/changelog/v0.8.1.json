[RME #4](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor/issues/4)\r\n- Improved spacing on popover menus [#661](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/662)\r\n- Documents are now only marked as viewed after a few seconds instead of immediately. This should reduce false positives when rapidly clicking through collections.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Some characters were being displayed as escaped in the document and window titles to a change in the underlying document save format â€“ this is now fixed up.
