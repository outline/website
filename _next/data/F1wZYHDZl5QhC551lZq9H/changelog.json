For Outline it was the biggest year ever for new features, fixes, and the growing community. Whether you’ve been following intently or this is the first time you’ve come across Outline here are some highlights from the past year:\n\n### 📝 A new editor\n\nWe started the year with a new editor, completely rewritten from the ground up on the [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net) framework. It’s now several orders of magnitude faster than the previous version at rendering both large and small documents, mobile compatible and a really solid base for the future. The editor is [open sourced](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) under a BSD license so you can play around with it in your projects too.\n\n### ⚡️ Performance\n\nI was already proud of Outline’s performance, and this year continued that focus. Special effort was put into dropping the initial download size of the entire application by more than 2Mb’s to ensure the app loads incredibly fast and documents load in milliseconds. \n\n### 🆕 New content types\n\nWith the new editor came new functionality such as highlights, notice blocks, and rich embeds like Google Slides – plus a /slash menu for quickly performing actions with only the keyboard. A special focus was also put on linking with automatic backlinks, on-demand creation of new docs from within the editor, and [hover previews for internal links](https://www.getoutline.com/changelog/v0.45.0). All this and still fully Markdown compatible.\n\n![New notice blocks](https://www.getoutline.com/images/notice-panels.png)\n\n### 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 Permissions + access\n\nIn March we made strides in improving the Outline experience for different kinds of teams with the addition of [groups](https://www.getoutline.com/changelog/v0.41.0), group permissions, and read-only access to collections. Email sign-in for guests that aren’t part of your main organization and optional [custom domains](https://www.getoutline.com/changelog/custom-domains) we’re also added.\n\n![Custom domains](https://www.getoutline.com/images/custom-domains.png)\n\n### 📄 Shared templates\n\nOne of the hardest things with building a team knowledge base is keeping consistency of information. In August we introduced team templates that let you define [shared templates](https://www.getoutline.com/changelog/document-templates) across the team that even include fillable “fields” to make starting new documents easy.\n\n![Shared templates](https://www.getoutline.com/images/use-template.png)\n\n### 🇺🇳 Translations\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of having an open codebase is the contributions that are made from all around the world. It was always an aim to translate Outline and this year [André](https://github.com/glaand) made that happen with implementation of the translation framework and process integrated with [CrowdIn](http://translate.getoutline.com/)\n\nOutline is now translated into [5 languages](https://www.getoutline.com/changelog/spanish-french-korean), with more just around the corner.\n\n### 🌎 Social impact\n\nWhen I think about the places that Outline should direct its impact as a company, top of the list is in helping efforts that are tackling climate change. It’s easy to ensure that our own operations are carbon neutral as the footprint is so small – but this year we’ve also comped accounts to teams and communities working on climate change, and as of November 1% of all revenue is being donated to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n### The year ahead…\n\nFor 2021 the roadmap is full and I’m excited to think about where the product will be by this time next year. Here’s a sneak peak of a couple of things that are “coming soon”… \\n \n\n* A continued focus on performance to ensure Outline remains the fastest knowledge base on the market.\n* “Bulk import” from other tools including Confluence and Notion\n* Realtime collaboration to allow multiple document editors at once","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/notice-panels.png"},{"title":"Community Translations","slug":"spanish-french-korean","date":"2020-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\nThe last few weeks has seen a surge of support in the community for [translating Outline](https://translate.getoutline.com).

In \nthe near future we’ll also publish recommended templates and make them easy to use from \nwithin your team.\n\n### How to create a template\n\nThere are two ways to create a template:\n\n1. Navigate to \"Templates\" in the left sidebar, then hit \"New template…\" in the top right, \nchoose a collection and write your template.\n2. Find an existing doc that you would like to create a template from, click on the overflow menu \"...\" (usually in the top right) and then \"Create template…\".\n\n![Outline create template](/images/create-template.png)\n\n\nOnce you’re editing a template, simply highlight some text and click on the new \"placeholder\" icon in the toolbar to convert the text into a placeholder that can be filled out by anyone that creates a new doc from the template.\n\n\n### How to use a template\n\nSimply start a new doc, a \"Templates\" option will appear in the top right corner until the \ndocument is first saved.\n\n![Outline use a template](/images/use-template.png)\n\n\n\n### Other fixes and improvements\n\n- Click on the last updated timestamp below the document title now opens the history sidebar.\n- The behavior of the floating toolbar was improved.\n- It is now possible to toggle the state of checkboxes without explicitly going into \"Edit\".\n- When a document is publicly shared this is now denoted by a globe icon in the share button.\n- Fixed some ugly styling issues introduced by the latest Chrome releases.\n- Fixed an issue where after you have chosen a collection icon it might get reset if you continue to edit the collection name.\n- Fixed a case where websocket connections would not reconnect automatically.\n- Fixed an issue that would prevent editing the beginning of long collection descriptions.\n- Fixed rendering of GitHub Gist embeds.\n- Fixed an error that could on rare occasions cause the app to form a reload loop.","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/create-template.png"},{"title":"New notice panels","slug":"notice-panels","date":"2020-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"","content":"\n![Outline notice panels](/images/notice-panels.png)\n\nThis week we added a new content type for your documents called \"notices\".

The [editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) is entirely rebuilt from the ground up for extensibility and speed, allowing us to move faster than ever before and is the culmination of more than 4 months of planning and work.\r\n\r\nThe improvements and fixes are almost too numerous to count, but the most important are listed below:\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Document rendering performance increased by leaps and bounds, some of our extreme test documents went from 30seconds -> 300ms to render\r\n- A new menu for inserting blocks is much more intuitive than before, type \"/\" at the beginning of a line or hit the \"+\" button to trigger\r\n\r\n![Outline block menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/380914/82714444-676a8f00-9c43-11ea-99f3-c89b6536c10b.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Updating a document's title now also updates any links to the document in other docs automatically\r\n- \"Highlight\" now appears as an option in the formatting menu\r\n- It's now possible to type a url in markdown formatting\r\n- Quotes are converted to smart quotes as you type\r\n- Support for paragraph breaks in list items\r\n- It's now possible to choose the \"system\" theme and have Outline follow your system's dark mode preference – this is especially useful on macOS when dark mode is set to \"auto\" to go dark in the evenings.\r\n\r\n![Outline appearance preference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/380914/82713920-8a943f00-9c41-11ea-9f32-ce381b90f1c3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Support for alternative input methods, this finally brings the fix for typing in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and all other languages that use a soft keyboard for input.\r\n- Restored the ability to disable embeds on a single doc in the context menu\r\n- Fixed some extra scrollbars that appear depending on your input device\r\n- It's now possible to save a document with only a title\r\n- Long titles now wrap onto multiple lines again\r\n- Document headings are centered correctly again when scrolled\r\n- Adding a new row to a table now respects column alignment\r\n- Improved key handling in link editor\r\n- Issues with markdown shortcuts surrounded in whitespace not applying","image":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/380914/82714444-676a8f00-9c43-11ea-99f3-c89b6536c10b.gif"},{"title":"v0.42.2","slug":"v0.42.2","date":"2020-04-11T17:52:57.000Z","tag":"v0.42.2","content":"    \n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Buttons now stand out better in dark mode\r\n- If the editor fails to load because a deploy happened the app will now auto-recover\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a regression in the styling of document titles in dark mode\r\n- Improved the usability of the image cropping tool in dark mode\r\n- Escape characters no longer incorrectly appear in the table of contents","image":""},{"title":"v0.42.1","slug":"v0.42.1","date":"2020-04-06T05:50:24.000Z","tag":"v0.42.1","content":"    \n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Crash on share links introduced in previous release\r\n- Crash on editing documents with image/embed as first node","image":""},{"title":"v0.42.0","slug":"v0.42.0","date":"2020-04-06T01:27:28.000Z","tag":"v0.42.0","content":"    \n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- The table of contents moved from being hidden on the edge of the screen to optionally toggleable inline with the document content.
