You can also create\nrepetitive task lists in templates.\n\n\n### Document history improvements\n\nThe history sidebar was rebuilt to shows more than just edits, it now also includes archive,\ndelete, publish, moves, and other events that happen during the document's lifetime.\n\nYou can find the new sidebar by clicking on the last edited timestamp or under \"History\" in the\ndocument menu.\n\n![document history](/images/document-history.png)\n\n\n### Other fixes and improvements\n\n- We've made a number of server-side performance improvements\n- The \"Home\" tab now defaults to show recently viewed documents\n- Fixed an issue that potentially suppressed email notifications for document edits\n- Fixed the templates page erroring when scrolled","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/task-list.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
