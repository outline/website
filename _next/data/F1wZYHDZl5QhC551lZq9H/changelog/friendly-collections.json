Not only is this nicer to look at, but it also makes quickly returning to\ncollections via searching in the address bar much easier!\n\n### Other fixes and improvements\n\n- Application size was decreased by several hundred KB\n- Shortcut for toggling the Table of Contents was changed to `ctrl`+`alt`+`h`\n- New language option â€“ PortugÃªse (Brazil) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·\n- Copying a share link to clipboard no longer includes dark mode styles when pasting into another rich editor\n- Fixed alignment of items in \"New from template\" menu\n- Fixed an issue where two `Restore` options would appear on a deleted document that was previously archived\n- Fixed background color of select inputs in dark mode on non-Mac platforms\n- Improved the performance of loading share links for documents with many attachments","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/friendly-url.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
