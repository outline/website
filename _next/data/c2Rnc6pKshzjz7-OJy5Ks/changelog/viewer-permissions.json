It's now possible to make a user a \"viewer\" at \nthe team level, meaning they will not be able to edit any collections or documents\nat all.\n\nWe also added the option to make the default access level for a collection \"view only\",\nyou can then select just a couple of team members to have edit permissions.\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Added the ability to drag and drop files into the collection screen\n- Improved and more comprehensive translations\n- Visual improvements to dark mode styling and mobile context menus\n- Added a /logout route to support SLO \n- When viewing a public share route while signed in with edit permissions an \"Edit\" button is now displayed\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Suspending a user now logs them out of any active sessions immediately\n- When a suspended user tries to sign in with email the situation is now explained more clearly to them\n- Fixed an error in the shares.info API endpoint when the user that originally creating share has been deleted\n- Fixed an issue with invisible list bullets in Firefox\n- Fixed a rare error when moving documents\n- Fixed embed support for Lucid Charts on the lucid.app domain","image":"https://www.getoutline.com/images/viewer-permissions.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
